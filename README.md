# bangla-compound-character-classification
This project was built for my Neural Networks course, where the goal was to classify 120 different Bangla handwritten compound characters. To tackle this, I used a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a multi-stage self-attention mechanism to better focus on important spatial features during classification.
